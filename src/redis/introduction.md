In this set of tutorials, you will be introduced to the following set of Redis data structure types using a hypothetical bike shop use case:

- strings - used for storing sequences of bytes, including text, images, and serialized objects.
- lists - ordered linked lists of string values that can be used to implement stacks (LIFO), queues (FIFO), producer-consumer patterns, and more.
- sets - unordered collections of unique strings that can be used to represent relations and track unique items.
- sorted sets - collections of unique strings, which are ordered by an associated score, that can be used for rate limiters and game leaderboards.
- hashes - record types, structured as collections of field-value pairs, used to represent objects.
